## Gregory Harrison, Spring 2023 Research 

This Repo contians the code that generates xgboost forecasts for the EFI NEON Challenge. 

### Files: 

- `Aquatics_ParallelXGB.R`: Script that produces forecasts for all variables of the aquatics theme
- `Phenology_ParallelXGB.R`: Script that produces forecasts for all variables of the phenology theme
- `Terrestrial_ParallelXGB.R`: Script that produces forecasts for all variables of the terrestrial theme
- `PresentationSP23.qmd`: Final Presentation generating markdown
- `Generic_ParallelXGB copy.R`: Script that should be used as a template for producing new forecast models. Changes to theme, input weather varaibles, target variables, and model id can all be made within lines 17 and 28. 

### R helper fuctions: 

- `R/forecast_site.R`: Function that actually trains the xgboost model on data, target variables, etc.
- `R/noaa_mean_forecast.R`: Get daily average temperature from each ensemble in future
- `R/noaa_mean_historical.R`: For each site, average over predicted 0h horizon ensembles to get 'historic values'
